# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## MY PROJECT

Mongoose and Postman are implemented in this project as methods to make and test the database. Main features are utilized by the server router to interact with databases. The feautures are to find, findById and to create. They update users and items. ESlint is used to organize the code by finding and fixing JavaScript errors relating to the server.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
